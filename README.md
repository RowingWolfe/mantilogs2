# mantilogs
I'll get around to writing this later. It's a Django app, written in Python3 and using SQLite for the DB.

Currently the work is focused on bug fixes and then frontend improvements as well as QOL.
Soon I hope to be adding better forms, possibly in React. I'll have to write some endpoints to process the JSON.


After that I will be adding new features like a QR code function that will open a profile for whatever the QR code is linked to just to make things a little quicker for data entry.

For now it is setup to log cultures of insects, mantids and geckos. I've got a basic morph model for the geckos but I feel like I may change it a bit when I add the functions for genetic calculators.

Also has a secondary project for logging environmental variables. I moved and my environemntal logging node I built out of an ESP32 was disassembled and needs to be rebuilt. I will also write a version for esp8266 when I have time so it's cheaper to make. Only used the 32 because I had one with a built-in OLED display.
