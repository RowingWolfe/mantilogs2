# mantilogs
I'll get around to writing this later. It's a Django app, written in Python3 and using SQLite.

Currently the work is focused on bug fixes and then frontend improvements.
After that I will be adding new features and more intuitive forms for input as well as a QR code function that will open a dashboard for whatever the QR code is on.

For now it is setup to log cultures, mantis and geckos. I've got a basic morph model for the geckos but I feel like I may change it a bit when I add the functions for genetic calculators.

Also testing webhooks.
